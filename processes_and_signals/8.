Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander 
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.
